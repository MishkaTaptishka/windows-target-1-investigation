MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Tactic: Initial Access
Technique: [T1110.001] Brute Force â€“ Password Guessing
- Numerous failed login attempts against windows-target-1 originated from external IP addresses.
- Usernames targeted included: administrator, admin, user, test, guest, and variants.

Tactic: Credential Access
Technique: [T1110] Brute Force
- High-volume login attempts from IPs such as:
	REDACTED IP
	REDACTED IP
	REDACTED IP
- These IPs are consistent with known scanning and brute-force behavior.

Tactic: Defense Evasion (Attempted)
Technique: [T1036] Masquerading
- Use of alternate username spellings (administrateur, admin1, administrator, admin2) possibly intended to bypass detection or exploit default credentials.

Findings:
- All successful logons were performed by known users: labuser, labuser1.
- No unauthorized accounts successfully accessed the system.
- Multiple external IPs made repeated failed attempts over the 30-day period.

Recommendations:
- Block Malicious IPs
- Investigate the most active Remote IPs for prior threat intelligence matches.
- Temporarily block or geo-fence high-risk IPs.
- Implement Account Lockout Policy
- Lock accounts temporarily after repeated failed logins to mitigate brute-force attacks.
- Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Protect high-value endpoints and admin accounts with MFA.
- Remove Internet Exposure
- If external access is not required, ensure windows-target-1 is isolated to internal network only.
- Enable Logging Alerts

Set up alerts for:
- Repeated failed logons
- Remote logons from unfamiliar IPs
- Authentication from unusual geolocations
